This is the JavaScript notifier for capturing errors in web browsers and reporting them to [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io).

## Installation

Using npm:

```
npm install airbrake-js
```

or using Bower:

```
bower install airbrake-js-client
```

## Setup

Notifier uses [standalone browserify build](http://www.forbeslindesay.co.uk/post/46324645400/standalone-browserify-builds) and can be used with:
- [RequireJS](examples/requirejs/app.js).
- [Global/Window](examples/legacy/app.js).

## Basic Usage

First you need to initialize notifier with project id and API key taken from [Airbrake.io](https://airbrake.io):

    var airbrake = new AirbrakeClient({projectId: 1, projectKey: 'abc'});

The simplest method is to report errors directly:

    try {
      // This will throw if the document has no head tag
      document.head.insertBefore(document.createElement("style"));
    } catch(err) {
      airbrake.push(err);
      throw err;
    }

Alternatively you can wrap any code which may throw errors using the client's `wrap` method:

    var startApp = function() {
      // This will throw if the document has no head tag.
      document.head.insertBefore(document.createElement("style"));
    }
    startApp = airbrake.wrap(startApp);

    // Any exceptions thrown in startApp will be reported to Airbrake.
    startApp();

## Advanced Usage

### Default Annotations

It's possible to annotate error notices with all sorts of useful information. Below, the various top-level interface methods are listed, along with their effects.

* `airbrake.setEnvironmentName(string)` sets the environment name, e.g. production or staging.
* `airbrake.addEnvironment(object)` adds environment information reported alongside all errors.
* `airbrake.addParams(object)` adds params information reported alongside all errors.
* `airbrake.addSession(object)` adds session information reported alongside all errors.
* `airbrake.addContext(object)` adds context information reported alongside all errors. This hash is reserved for notifier and Airbrake backend will ignore unknown keys.

Additionally, much of this information can be added to captured errors at the time they're captured by supplying it in the object being reported.

    try {
      startApp();
    } catch (err) {
      airbrake.push({
        error:       err,
        environment: { env1: 'value1' },
        params:      { param1: 'param1' },
        session:     { param2: 'param2' },
        context:     { component: 'boostrap' }
      });
      throw err;
    }

### Error object

Instead of exception you can pass error object constructed manually. For example, `window.onerror` handler can look like:

    window.onerror = function(message, file, line) {
      airbrake.push({error: {message: message, fileName: file, lineNumber: line}});
    }

### Source map

In order to enable source map support you have to specify path to the source map file according to the [source map specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit#heading=h.lmz475t4mvbx). For example, airbrake.min.js has following line:

    //# sourceMappingURL=airbrake.min.map

### Filtering errors

There may be some errors thrown in your application that you're not interested in sending to Airbrake, such as errors thrown by 3rd-party libraries, or by browser extensions run by your users.

The Airbrake notifier makes it simple to ignore this chaff while still processing legitimate errors. Add filters to the notifier by providing filter functions to `addFilter`.

`addFilter` accepts the entire error notice to be sent to Airbrake, and provides access to the `context`, `environment`, `params`, and `session` values submitted with the notice, as well as the single-element `errors` array with its `backtrace` element and associated backtrace lines.

The return value of the filter function determines whether or not the error notice will be submitted.
  * If a falsey value is returned, the notice is suppressed.
  * If a truthy value is returned, the notice may be admissible for submission.

An error notice must pass all provided filters to be submitted.

    // Here we suppress the notice if the top-level `session` key
    // indicates the user is logged in as an admin
    airbrake.addFilter(function(notice) {
      // Suppress reports from admin sessions
      return !notice.session.admin;
    });

### Custom reporters

If you're interested in inspecting the information reported to Airbrake in your own code, you can register your own error reporter. Note that reporters added this way may be executed out-of-order.

In this example, reported errors are also logged to the console.

    <script>
      airbrake.addReporter(function(notice) {
        console.log(notice);
      });
    </script>
